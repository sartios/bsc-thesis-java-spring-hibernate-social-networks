### SOCIAL NETWORK SNIFFER ###

Today there are many social network platforms like Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, etc. They provide a mechanism so people can communicate with text and multimedia.

The number of social network users has increased dramatically from the begging. The informations that they provide everyday, is the main reason people use it.

When a user has a big number of friends can't be updated with every information they published. A better approach would be to select what he is interested in by giving keywords. So when his friends will publish something about it he will get a notification.

This is the idea that our application implements.
